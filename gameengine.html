				My biggest and longest project up to date. It began as a map and asset editor for one of my games in 2019, 
				but I quickly found more interest in developing tools for the game than the game itself, 
				so I abandoned the game and focused solely on the engine. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The initial assumptions were simple: 
				<ul>
					<li>Only 2D</li>
					<li>Full editor</li>
					<li>Entity-Component-System</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				Back then, I was using Dear ImGui for UI, Lua for scripting and SFML for pretty much everything else (rendering, input, window creation, etc.) in my game, so naturally I based my engine on them too. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The video below shows the state of the engine in February 2021.

				<br/>
				<br/>
				
				Unfortunately, after a while, I started realizing the severe limitations imposed by both, the way I implemented systems and the libraries I chose to use.
				<br/>
				Examples:
				<ul>
					<li>Every script needed its own native code that exposed its members to the editor.</li>
					<li>Lua is a dynamically typed language, and a lot of functionality I wanted, either required or would be much easier to implement with static typing.</li>
					<li>At one point, the rendering capabilities of SFML became insufficient, and I had a few performance issues with it.</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				The first issue I addressed was the scripting language. After some research, I decided to choose AngelScript which is statically typed, 
				easy to integrate with C/C++ (much easier than Lua, and there is no need for any binding library), 
				and the language itself has almost everything I would want from a scripting language. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Next, I focused on rendering, this took a lot of time as I experimented with different solutions, such as: mixing legacy OpenGL with SFML, modern OpenGL or using the BGFX library. 
				Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. In the end, I decided to make my own abstraction for rendering that is capable of targeting different backends.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The next decision was to switch from SFML to SDL2, as it supports much more platforms and is more actively maintained. 
				I also decided to divide my codebase into multiple dynamic libraries and expose their functionalities through a C API. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				After many more ideas and decisions related to what I want from this project, I set up current goals, some of which are: 
				
				<ul>
					<li>Primary 2D, but having some simple 3D support, like the ability to render 3D objects on a 2D layer.</li>
					<li>Very cross-platform, including retro consoles like PSP and 3DS (and pretty much everything that is more powerful and capable and has open source SDK and toolchain), 
					this will prove challenging in some aspects, but challenges are what make achievements satisfying after all.</li>
					<li>End user must be able to build a game for the target platform without having to install an SDK or toolchain for the target platform.</li>
					<li>A full editor that can be expanded in functionality either by scripts or dynamic libraries.</li>
					<li>Configurable build pipeline, for example, choosing the compression method for image assets used by the final game build.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br/>
				
				It will take quite a while before any game could be made with this engine (if ever), but I have great fun making it.
